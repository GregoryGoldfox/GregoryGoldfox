- I'm Igor Doudelzak. Beginner DevOps engineer, backend developer. I live in Novi Sad. Looking for a job.
- I'm learning Ansible, DevOps tools and programming language C. I have decent experience in python. Also, i know a couple of things about setting up a network and I had experience on configuring linux servers and programming telegram bots in python(was setting up sqlalchemy for connection with sqlite3). I studied in school with IT specialty in Novi Sad, so I have some experience with DOTNET applications and websites.
- I have a couple of projects-repositories written in python. You can see them soon enough in my GitHub profile when I'll finish polishing them.
- My stack for websites is:
  - Html, css, javascript(Pretty bad with these)
  - Python with FastAPI framework for endpoints
  - MySQL(sqlalchemy to be able to work with dbs)
- You can reach me in telegram(link is in my GitHub profile), in discord: gregorygoldfox, or in email: igor.doudelzak@gmail.com
